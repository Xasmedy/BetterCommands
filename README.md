# BetterCommands - Mindustry Plugin.
[mindustry.ddns.net - Discord](https://discord.gg/6gaRWsp).

The scope of this plugin is to make available some console commands for admins. But there'll be more commands available for moderation and even players.

This plugin was planed to be made only for *mindustry.ddns.net* but I decided to make it public but get credits.

### Available commands:

- Info
- Ban
- Unban
- Kick
- Pause
- Runwave
- Repeatwave
- Jumpwave
- Gameover

## How to use

Search the `config` folder, inside it there is the `mods` folder, but the jar downloaded inside and start the server. All commands should appear be ready, you can do */help* for more info.

### Requirement

- Java 15
- Mindustry 123v

_If you want to be able use our plugin, you need to give credits to mindustry.ddns.net in your server, else you are a bad person and I will stop release public updates._
