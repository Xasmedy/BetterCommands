# BetterCommands - Mindustry Plugin.
[mindustry.ddns.net - Discord](https://discord.gg/6gaRWsp).

The scope of this plugin is make available some console commands for admins. But there will be new commands available for moderation and even players!

The plugin was planed to be made only for the *mindustry.ddns.net* server but I decided to make it public and get credits.

### Available commands:

- Info
- Ban
- Unban
- Kick
- Pause
- Runwave
- Repeatwave
- Jumpwave
- Gameover

## How to use

Search the `config` inside this folder you will see `mods` put the jar downloaded inside and start the server. All commands will be ready and for more info you can do */help* in chat.

---

If you want to change the "DDNS.net" prefix, you need to go inside the Util class and modify the `public static final namePrefix`. Time you did it open a terminal and build the jar with `gradle jar`, once you did it the jar will be inside the `build/libs` folder. _(In the future change it will be way easier)_

_If you want to be able use our plugin, you need to give credits to mindustry.ddns.net in your server, else you are a bad person and I will stop release public updates._
