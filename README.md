# BetterCommands - Mindustry Plugin.
[mindustry.ddns.net - Discord](https://discord.gg/6gaRWsp).

### Plugin v7 update.

After some incentives I decided to update this plugin to the latest version of Mindustry.<br>
Naturally I will re-write the code to take advantage of the new features and I will likely add new commands.

## The information bellow might be outdated.

### Available commands:

- Info
- Ban
- Unban
- Kick
- Pause
- Runwave
- Repeatwave
- Jumpwave
- Gameover

## How to use

Where you have the jar file, search a folder called `config`, inside it you will find another folder called `mods`, put the BetterCommands jar in there, and start the server. Once the server starts, all commands will be loaded and ready for be used, you can see the commands list by doing */help* in chat.

---

If you want to change the prefix, you need to go inside the Util class and modify the `public static final namePrefix`. Once you do it, build the project and get the jar from the builded folder. For buildind the project you need to do `gradle jar` inside the IDE or your terminal.
