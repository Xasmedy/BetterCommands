### The plugin will receive more updates.

**The plugin is now available for v143! There will be more updates but slow ones. (better than none) 
The scope of this plugin is make available some console commands for admins. But there will be new commands available for moderation and even players!
The plugin was planed to be made only for the *mindustry.ddns.net* server but I decided to make it public and get credits.

### Available commands:

Get the release .jar from the GitHub page and install it inside the `mods` directory.<br>
This plugin also requires the [MAPIE](https://github.com/Xasmedy/MAPIE) library, its .jar needs to be installed inside `mods/libs/`.
